            India has made significant contributions to satellite technology, particularly through projects like
            <font color="blue"> GSAT
                (Communication Satellite) </font>and<font color="blue"> NAVIC (India's regional GPS system)</font>.
            These
            advancements have had a
            profound
            impact on weather prediction, navigation, and disaster management across India.<br>
            <hr>
            <FONT COLOR="green"> GSAT Series:</FONT>

            The GSAT series are communication satellites that also contribute to weather forecasting and monitoring.
            Through the <FONT COLOR="BLUE">INSAT system</font>, India can track weather patterns, monitor cyclones,
            and
            predict
            monsoon patterns, which are critical for agriculture and disaster preparedness.<BR>

            <font color="green">Weather Monitoring and Forecasting:</font> GSAT monitor weather conditions,
            including
            temperature, humidity, and
            atmospheric pressure. They help generate accurate weather forecasts and track weather systems such as
            cyclones, storms, and monsoons.<br>

            <font color="green"> Cyclone tracking:</font>Satellites like GSAT-19 and GSAT-30 track tropical storms
            and cyclones, providing
            real-time
            data for early warnings and evacuations.<br>


            <font color="green">Agricultural Support: </font> weather data collected is crucial for agriculture,
            helping farmers prepare for
            changes in weather patterns like rainfall and drought.


            <font color="green"> NAVIC series:</font>

            India developed NAVIC, a regional satellite navigation system, to provide precise positioning services
            across India and surrounding regions.NAVIC is just like GPS, but it is more accurate.<br>

            NAVIC offers an accurate positioning service with an accuracy of<u> 20 meters</u>. It also enhances
            navigation
            for
            road vehicles, ships and aircraft, ensuring better safety and operational efficiency. It is especially
            useful in areas where GPS signals may be weak or unavailable.<br>

            Shipping Industry: For the Indian Navy and commercial shipping, NAVIC ensures secure navigation in
            national
            waters and reduces the risk of accidents or loss of vessels.<br>

            NAVIC’s regional focus ensures that India has complete control over its navigation infrastructure, a
            crucial
            advantage in terms of national security and strategic operations.

            India's contribution shows that GSAT and NavIC have had a profound impact on the country’s
            technological,
            economic, and social development. By advancing in space technology, India has made significant progress
            in
            weather forecasting, navigation, and disaster management, while also improving national security,
            infrastructure, and public safety.<br>
